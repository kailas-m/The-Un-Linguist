# The Un-Linguist ü§ñüéØ

### Project Description
A web app that takes perfectly coherent AI-generated responses‚Ä¶ and then gleefully scrambles them into a chaotic mess of multilingual gibberish. Sometimes it‚Äôs French, sometimes it‚Äôs Russian, sometimes it‚Äôs just confusion in a trench coat.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world suffers from too much clarity in communication. Messages are being understood, conversations are flowing smoothly, and misunderstandings are at an all-time low. Disgusting.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We inject glorious confusion into AI responses by translating them into random languages sentence-by-sentence and adding optional ciphered text to keep everyone guessing. It‚Äôs like Google Translate on a roller coaster.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Languages: Python, HTML, CSS
-Frameworks: Django
-Libraries: OpenAI API (via OpenRouter), NLTK, Requests, python-dotenv, LibreTranslate API
-Tools: Docker (for LibreTranslate), Git, VS Code
For Hardware:
- A working laptop
-A stable internet connection (sometimes stable, mostly not)
-A brain that enjoys chaos

When a user visits The Un-Linguist web app, they are greeted with a clean and minimal interface featuring a text input box and a ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button. The user simply types any message ‚Äî from casual greetings to curious questions ‚Äî and submits it. Upon submission, the page refreshes to display three distinct outputs: a coherent AI-generated response, a humorously distorted ‚Äúabsurd multilingual‚Äù version created by passing the original reply through multiple translations, and a Morse code version accompanied by a small decoding clue. This simple yet quirky interface allows the user to repeatedly input new messages and instantly see these playful transformations without any complicated navigation or clutter.
