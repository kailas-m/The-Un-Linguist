# The Un-Linguist ü§ñüéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Errors

### Project Description
A web app that takes perfectly coherent AI-generated responses‚Ä¶ and then gleefully scrambles them into a chaotic mess of multilingual gibberish. Sometimes it‚Äôs French, sometimes it‚Äôs Russian, sometimes it‚Äôs just confusion in a trench coat.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world suffers from too much clarity in communication. Messages are being understood, conversations are flowing smoothly, and misunderstandings are at an all-time low. Disgusting.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We inject glorious confusion into AI responses by translating them into random languages sentence-by-sentence and adding optional ciphered text to keep everyone guessing. It‚Äôs like Google Translate on a roller coaster.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
-Languages: Python, HTML, CSS
-Frameworks: Django
-Libraries: OpenAI API (via OpenRouter), NLTK, Requests, python-dotenv, LibreTranslate API
-Tools: Docker (for LibreTranslate), Git, VS Code
For Hardware:
- A working laptop
-A stable internet connection (sometimes stable, mostly not)
-A brain that enjoys chaos
